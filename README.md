**NOTE: `PhotochemPy` is no longer maintained and persists on Github for archival purposes only. My most up to date photochemical code is instead called `photochem`: https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/photochem . Please used `photochem` instead of `PhotochemPy`.**

PhotochemPy is a photochemical model of planet's atmospheres. Given inputs, like the stellar UV flux, the atmospheric temperature structure, etc., this code will find the steady-state chemical composition of an atmosphere, or evolve atmospheres through time.

<!-- [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/photochempy/badge/?version=latest)](https://photochempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) -->

PhotochemPy is a Python wrapper to Fortran source code. This makes the code very speedy, but also user-friendly.

## Installation

You need a Fortran compiler (`gfortran>=9.30`, [install instructions here](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran)) and C compiler (e.g. install with `conda install -c conda-forge clang`). Also you must use MacOS or Linux OS. Windows does not work.

Create a `conda` environment with all dependencies

```sh
conda create -n photochempy -c conda-forge python numpy=1.21 scipy scikit-build
```

Clone or download the github repository. Navigate to the root directory with a terminal, activate your new `conda` environment, then install with setup.py:

```sh
conda activate photochempy
python setup.py install
```

**Fortran library only:** If you prefer to use the code exclusively in Fortran, that is OK too. You can build `libphotochem` with CMake. Download or clone this respository, then from the root directory of the repository run

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
```

## History
PhotochemPy is a distant fork of the [Atmos](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos) photochemical model, originally developed by Jim Kasting and Kevin Zahnle and further developed by many of their students and colleges.

If you have questions email me: wogan@uw.edu

Also, if you plan on using PhotochemPy for a publication please email me before you submit anything to a journal, just so we can confirm your planned application of the model is reasonable.
